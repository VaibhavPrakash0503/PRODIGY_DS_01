Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset provided, focusing on creating a visualization to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this task is [world_population_dataset](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL). This dataset contains records of population from the year 2001 to 2022.
## Tools and Libraries used
